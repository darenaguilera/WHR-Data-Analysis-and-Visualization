### Data Analysis on the World Happiness Report 2023

Group project as per curriculum for UCSB's course PSTAT 100: Data Science Concepts and Analysis. 

- Developed a comprehensive data analysis project applying the World Happiness Report 2023 dataset, focusing on trends in
happiness and well-being metrics across 160 countries from 2008 to 2022.

- Employed extensive use of Pandas for sophisticated data manipulation procedures. Addressed strategic imputation and data filtering
to ensure data integrity and reliability.

- Conducted thorough EDA to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships, to deepen domain knowledge of high-dimension qualitative data. Executed various statistical methods and visualizations to analyze various contributing factors.

- Designed and implemented a suite of insightful data visualizations using Altair and Matplotlib. Showcasing the expansive use of plots to
communicate findings and trends in the data.

- Applied statistical techniques and regression models to explore correlations and changes, leveraging Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) for dimensionality reduction where relevant.

- Developed a well-structured report, combining code, visualizations, and narrative to present the analysis process and findings in a
clear, concise manner.

- Delivered insights on global happiness trends, identified countries with significant improvements in happiness scores, and examined
the relationship between various metrics of well-being.

- Utilized Python, Pandas, Altair, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook, and Google Collaboratory.
